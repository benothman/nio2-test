to run these examples you may use shell scripts, there are three scripts.
In these examples there are three kind of servers, the first one uses a
normal ServerSocketChannel, the second one uses a Selector for three
ServerSocketChannel and the last one uses uses an AsynchronousServerSocketChannel


1) To run servers, use the following command line
  * mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.jboss.nio2.server.sync.Nio2Server" -Dexec.args="port"
  * mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.jboss.nio2.server.selector.Nio2SelectorServer" -Dexec.args="port"
  * mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.jboss.nio2.server.async.Nio2AsyncServer" -Dexec.args="port"
 
 
 2) To run clients, use the following command line
  * sh run_sync.sh host port n delay
  * sh run_async.sh host port n delay
  * sh run_selector.sh host n delay
  For a generic client, which uses simple java.io, that can be applied to all servers may be lunched
  as follow:
    sh run.sh host port n delay
  
  host: the server hostname/IP
  port: the server port
  n: the number of threads
  delay: the delay between each two requests
